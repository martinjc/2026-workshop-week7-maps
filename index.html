    <h1>2026 Wales Senedd Election</h1>
    <p>The 2026 Senedd election in Wales will be the first conducted under a new proportional representation system. Wales has been divided into 16 constituencies, each of which will elect 6 members to the Senedd. On these pages are some maps that attempt to deal with the problem of visualising election results under this system.</p>

    <h2><a href="choro.html">Choropleth - geographic area map</a></h2>
    <p>This map shows the actual geographic boundaries of the constituencies. As the constituencies vary significantly in size, this can give a misleading impression of the distribution of support for different parties. It is also not clear how we would represent the results of a proportional representation system on this map.</p>

    <h2><a href="hex.html">Hexmap - fixed area hexmap</a></h2>
    <p>There are 2 hexmaps here. The first uses a single hexagon to represent each constituency, with each Senedd member represented by a triangle covering 1/6 of the hexagon. The second uses 6 hexagons to represent each constituency, with one MS per hexagon.</p>
    <p>Hexmaps are useful for representing election results as each hexagon (or triangle) can represent one member, making it easy to see how many members each party has won in each area. However, as the hexagons are not in their true geographic locations, this can make it harder to see the overall geographic distribution of support for different parties.</p>
